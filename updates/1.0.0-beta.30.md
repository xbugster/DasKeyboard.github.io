* Redesigned home page (new UI and UX).

* Changed the look of the menu drop downs, and of the tooltips.

* Optimized the proportions of the starting screen (now depending of the monitor size), to remove the scroll bars when X50 is selected.

* Tweaks in the communication with the service (should fix various cases when the connection is lost or stuck, and needed restart of the service, the Q Desktop, or both).

* Added communication support for X50 devices (still need a new X50 firmware to test it).
