            <li>Download the firmware file. If the 5Q firmware is up to date, the installer will not perform the upgrade. The current 5Q firmware version is displayed on the home page of the Q Desktop software. It is also displayed when running the firmware upgrade application.</li>
            <li>IMPORTANT: Quit the Q Desktop App. Do not just click on the upper right "X" but find quit in the menu located in the upper right corner of the Q Desktop App. The flash update will not proceed and your keyboard will blink unless the Q App is terminated.</li>
            <li>Double click the firmware file to “Run” it. Windows 10 Defender may display a message regarding an “unrecognized app” that has been prevented from starting. You will need to run it in order to upgrade the firmware on the 5Q. To enable the firmware upgrade to proceed, please click on <code>More Info</code> and follow the prompts to run the upgrader and update the firmware.</li>
